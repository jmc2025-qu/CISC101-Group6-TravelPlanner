### **Module 2 — Plan Builder (Options → Days)**

- Generate and organize candidate activities per time of day.  
- Use a short loop to build a balanced day plan:
  - Morning → near lodging  
  - Midday → nearby attraction  
  - Afternoon → different theme  
  - Evening → restaurant or optional event

Create a short list of candidate activities (e.g., attractions, restaurants, parks).  
Each activity includes type, estimated duration, cost range, and distance.

Use a simple loop to build days:

for each day:  
    pick Morning activity (near lodging)  
    pick Midday activity (close by)  
    pick Afternoon activity (different theme)  
    pick Evening restaurant or optional event
