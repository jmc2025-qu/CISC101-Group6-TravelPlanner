### **3. Feasibility & Guardrails**

Apply internal **if/else** logic for realism and problem-solving:

- If venue closed → replace with indoor option nearby.  
- If restaurant over budget → switch to cheaper similar one.  
- If activities too far → select nearer or add transit.  
- If rainy/cold season → include at least one indoor backup.  
- If total time too long → shorten or simplify.  
- If mobility limits → add rest breaks and step-free venues.  
- If dietary restriction → ensure compliance.  
- If bookings needed → mention under Quick Checks only.
